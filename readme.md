## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

Something that was amazing in the process of building this landing page could be said of the styling bakground. Inserting gradient into the same background of an image, and customizing the location was for me a good thing to keep in my mind for next projects.
